# Stress-Testing-Mortgages
Risk analysis of artificial mortgage dataset based on Statistique Canada demographic data with Stress Testing against macroeconomic indicators

# Description:
This project simulates stress scenarios on synthetic mortgage data to assess risk exposure across borrower segments and identify systemic vulnerabilities. In short it evaluate how mortgage portfolios might behave under macroeconomic shocks.
